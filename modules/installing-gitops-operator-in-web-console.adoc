= Installing GitOps Operator in web console

.Prerequisites

* You are logged in to the OpenShift cluster as an administrator.

.Procedure

. Open the *Administrator* perspective of the web console and navigate to *Operators* â†’ *OperatorHub* in the menu on the left.

. Search for `OpenShift GitOps`, click the *Red Hat OpenShift GitOps* tile and then click the *Install* button.
+
Red Hat OpenShift GitOps will be installed in all namespaces of the cluster.

Once the Red Hat OpenShift GitOps Operator is installed, it automatically sets up a ready-to-use Argo CD instance that is available in the `openshift-gitops` namespace, and an Argo CD icon is displayed in the console toolbar.

If you have OpenShift GitOps Operator already installed on your cluster, the existing installation is seamlessly upgraded. 

NOTE: If you upgrade from v1.0.1, use the **stable** channel that enables installation of the latest stable and supported release of the Red Hat OpenShift GitOps Operator.
